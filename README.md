JAM is a rectified flow-based model for lyrics-to-song generation that addresses the lack of fine-grained word-level controllability in existing lyrics-to-song models. Built on a compact 530M-parameter architecture with 16 LLaMA-style Transformer layers as the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, JAM enables precise vocal control that musicians desire in their workflows. Unlike previous models, JAM provides word and phoneme-level timing control, allowing musicians to specify the exact placement of each vocal sound for improved rhythmic flexibility and expressive timing.

## News
> 📣 29/07/25: We have released JAM-0.5, the first version of the AI song generator from Project Jamify!

## Features

![cover-photo](jam-teaser.png)

- **Fine-grained Word and Phoneme-level Timing Control**: The first model to provide word-level timing and duration control in song generation, enabling precise prosody control for musicians
- **Compact 530M Parameter Architecture**: Less than half the size of existing models, enabling faster inference with reduced resource requirements
- **Enhanced Lyric Fidelity**: Achieves over 3× reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) and Phoneme Error Rate (PER) compared to prior work through precise phoneme boundary attention
- **Global Duration Control**: Controllable duration up to 3 minutes and 50 seconds.
- **Aesthetic Alignment through Direct Preference Optimization**: Iterative refinement using synthetic preference datasets to better align with human aesthetic preferences, eliminating manual annotation requirements

## The Pipeline

![cover-photo](jam.png)

## JAM Samples

Check out the example generated music in the `generated_examples/` folder to hear what JAM can produce:

- **`Hybrid Minds, Brodie - Heroin.mp3`** - Electronic music with synthesized beats and electronic elements
- **`Jade Bird - Avalanche.mp3`** - Country music with acoustic guitar and folk influences  
- **`Rizzle Kicks, Rachel Chinouriri - Follow Excitement!.mp3`** - Rap music with rhythmic beats and hip-hop style

These samples demonstrate JAM's ability to generate high-quality music across different genres while maintaining vocal intelligence, style consistency and musical coherence.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU with sufficient VRAM (8GB+ recommended)


## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/declare-lab/jamify
cd jam
```

### 2. Run Installation Script

The project includes an automated installation script, run it in your own virtual environment:

```bash
bash install.sh
```

This script will:
- Initialize and update git submodules (DeepPhonemizer)
- Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Install the JAM package in editable mode
- Install the DeepPhonemizer external dependency

### 3. Manual Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Initialize submodules
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install JAM package
pip install -e .

# Install DeepPhonemizer
pip install -e externals/DeepPhonemizer
```

## Quick Start

### Simple Inference

The easiest way to run inference is using the provided `inference.py` script:

```python
python inference.py
```

This script will:
1. Download the pre-trained JAM-0.5 model from Hugging Face
2. Run inference with default settings
3. Save generated audio to the `outputs` directory

### Input Format

Create an input file at `inputs/input.json` with your songs:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "my_song",
    "audio_path": "inputs/reference_audio.mp3",
    "lrc_path": "inputs/lyrics.json", 
    "duration": 180.0,
    "prompt_path": "inputs/style_prompt.txt"
  }
]
```

Required files:
- **Audio file**: Reference audio for style extraction
- **Lyrics file**: JSON with timestamped lyrics
- **Prompt file**: Text description of desired style/genre. Text prompt is not used in the default setting where the audio reference is utilized.

## Advanced Usage

### Using `python -m jam.infer`

For more control over the generation process:

```bash
# Basic usage with custom checkpoint
python -m jam.infer evaluation.checkpoint_path=path/to/model.safetensors

# With custom output directory
python -m jam.infer evaluation.checkpoint_path=path/to/model.safetensors evaluation.output_dir=my_outputs

# With custom configuration file
python -m jam.infer config=configs/my_config.yaml evaluation.checkpoint_path=path/to/model.safetensors
```

### Multi-GPU Inference

Use Accelerate for distributed inference:

```bash
# Basic usage with custom checkpoint
accelerate launch --config_path path/to/accelerate/config.yaml jam.infer

# With custom configuration file
accelerate launch --config_path path/to/accelerate/config.yaml jam.infer config=path/to/inference/config.yaml
```

## Configuration Options

### Key Parameters

#### Evaluation Settings
- `evaluation.checkpoint_path`: Path to model checkpoint (required)
- `evaluation.output_dir`: Output directory (default: "outputs")
- `evaluation.test_set_path`: Input JSON file (default: "inputs/input.json")
- `evaluation.batch_size`: Batch size for inference (default: 1)
- `evaluation.num_samples`: Only generate first n samples in test_set_path (null = all)
- `evaluation.vae_type`: VAE model type ("diffrhythm" or "stable_audio")

#### Style Control
- `evaluation.ignore_style`: Ignore style prompts (default: false)
- `evaluation.use_prompt_style`: Use text prompts for style (default: false)
- `evaluation.num_style_secs`: Style audio duration in seconds (default: 30)
- `evaluation.random_crop_style`: Randomly crop style audio (default: false)

## Input File Formats

### Lyrics File (`*.json`)
```json
[
    {"start": 2.2, "end": 2.5, "word": "First word of lyrics"},
    {"start": 2.5, "end": 3.7, "word": "Second word of lyrics"},
    {"more lines ...."}
]
```

### Style Prompt File (`*.txt`)
```
Electronic dance music with heavy bass and synthesizers
```

### Input Manifest (`input.json`)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique_song_id",
    "audio_path": "path/to/reference.mp3",
    "lrc_path": "path/to/lyrics.json",
    "duration": 180.0,
    "prompt_path": "path/to/style.txt"
  }
]
```

## Output Structure

Generated files are saved to the output directory:

```
outputs/
├── generated/          # Final trimmed audio files
├── generated_orig/     # Original generated audio
├── cfm_latents/       # Intermediate latent representations
├── local_files/       # Process-specific metadata
└── generation_config.yaml  # Configuration used for generation
```

## Performance Tips

1. **GPU Memory**: Use `evaluation.batch_size=1` for large on limited VRAM
2. **Multi-GPU**: Use `accelerate launch` for faster processing of multiple samples
3. **Mixed Precision**: Add `--mixed_precision=fp16` to reduce memory usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Checkpoint path not found"
```bash
# Make sure to specify the checkpoint path
python -m jam.infer evaluation.checkpoint_path=path/to/your/model.safetensors
```

#### "CUDA out of memory"
```bash
# Reduce batch size or use mixed precision
accelerate launch --mixed_precision=fp16 -m jam.infer evaluation.checkpoint_path=model.safetensors
```

#### "Test set not found"
```bash
# Create input.json file in inputs/ directory or specify custom path
python -m jam.infer evaluation.test_set_path=path/to/your/input.json evaluation.checkpoint_path=model.safetensors
```

## Model Downloads

The `inference.py` script automatically downloads the JAM-0.5 model. For manual download:

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
model_path = snapshot_download(repo_id="declare-lab/jam-0.5")
```
